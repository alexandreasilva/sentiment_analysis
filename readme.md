Sentiment Analysis for Social Media and Product Reviews
This project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool for analyzing sentiment in text data such as social media posts or product reviews. It's particularly useful for marketing analysis and measuring customer satisfaction.
Features

Text preprocessing and cleaning
Sentiment analysis using NLTK's VADER
Keyword extraction
Word cloud generation
Sentiment visualization
Trend analysis over time
Insight generation

Requirements
pip install nltk pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
Additionally, download the required NLTK resources:
pythonimport nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Project Structure
The project consists of several main components:

SentimentAnalyzer: Core class for text cleaning and sentiment analysis
DataProcessor: Handles loading data from different sources
SentimentVisualizer: Creates visualizations of the analysis results
InsightGenerator: Extracts insights and summaries from the analysis

Usage Examples
Basic Usage
pythonfrom sentiment_analysis_project import SentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()

# Analyze a single text
text = "I absolutely love this product! It's amazing!"
result = analyzer.analyze_sentiment(text)

print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']}")
print(f"Compound score: {result['compound']}")
print(f"Positive: {result['positive']}")
print(f"Negative: {result['negative']}")
print(f"Neutral: {result['neutral']}")
Analyzing a CSV File of Reviews
pythonfrom sentiment_analysis_project import SentimentAnalyzer, DataProcessor

# Initialize components
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()
processor = DataProcessor()

# Load CSV file (assuming it has 'review_text' and 'date' columns)
df = processor.load_csv('reviews.csv', text_column='review_text', date_column='date')

# Run batch analysis
results = analyzer.analyze_batch(df['review_text'].tolist())

# Add results to the dataframe
df['sentiment'] = [result['sentiment'] for result in results]
df['compound'] = [result['compound'] for result in results]

# Save the results
df.to_csv('analyzed_reviews.csv', index=False)
Visualizing Results
pythonfrom sentiment_analysis_project import SentimentVisualizer

# Initialize the visualizer
visualizer = SentimentVisualizer()

# Plot sentiment distribution
plt = visualizer.plot_sentiment_distribution(results)
plt.savefig('sentiment_distribution.png')

# Plot sentiment over time (if date data is available)
plt = visualizer.plot_sentiment_over_time(df)
plt.savefig('sentiment_trends.png')
Generating Insights
pythonfrom sentiment_analysis_project import InsightGenerator

# Initialize the insight generator
insight_gen = InsightGenerator()

# Generate summary insights
summary = insight_gen.generate_summary(results, texts)
print(summary['text_insights'])

# Find most positive and negative texts
extreme = insight_gen.identify_extreme_sentiments(results, texts, n=3)
print("Most positive texts:")
for score, text in extreme['most_positive']:
    print(f"[{score:.2f}] {text}")
Command Line Usage
The project can also be run from the command line:
bashpython sentiment_analysis_project.py --input reviews.csv --text-col review_text --date-col review_date --output results.csv
Example Output
The analysis generates:

CSV file with sentiment scores
Visualization images:

Sentiment distribution
Word clouds for positive and negative content
Sentiment trends over time


Summary insights:

Overall sentiment distribution
Average sentiment scores
Top keywords by sentiment
Most positive and negative texts



Applications

Customer Feedback Analysis: Identify patterns in customer reviews and comments
Social Media Monitoring: Track brand sentiment on Twitter, Facebook, etc.
Product Development: Understand what features customers like or dislike
Market Research: Compare sentiment across different products or categories
Trend Analysis: Monitor how sentiment changes over time

Customization
The sentiment analysis can be customized in several ways:

Modify the text cleaning process in clean_text() method
Adjust sentiment thresholds in analyze_sentiment() method
Add new data sources to the DataProcessor class
Create new visualization methods in the SentimentVisualizer class

Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:

Support for more languages
More advanced NLP techniques (e.g., aspect-based sentiment analysis)
Integration with more data sources (e.g., Twitter API, Reddit)
Machine learning models for sentiment classification
Interactive dashboards for visualization
